In order for the program to work, with your own database
you have to add to application.properties file all necessary data:

```
*** Database connection ***
spring.datasource.username
spring.datasource.password
spring.datasource.url
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect
spring.datasource.driver-class-name

*** Mail data ***
spring.mail.username
spring.mail.password
spring.mail.host
spring.mail.port
spring.mail.properties.mail.transport.protocol
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.port
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.required

*** domain url or if locally - localhost:8080 (or with other port) ***
www.domain.url

*** secret key for session tokens ***
secret.key.for.session.token

*** default admin user ***

```

It is in development stage, so look forward for future features:
